    Currently there are two approaches used to calculate (U–Th–Sm)/He
    ages using in situ methods. In the first (absolute) approach, the
    age is calculated from the measured concentrations of U, Th, (Sm)
    and He using the following equation:

    <p></p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    He/V =
    8 (137.88/138.88) (exp[&lambda;<sub>238</sub>t]-1) U +
    7 (exp[&lambda;<sub>235</sub>t]-1) U /138.88 + <br>
    6 (exp[&lambda;<sub>232</sub>t]-1) Th +
    0.1499 (exp[&lambda;<sub>147</sub>t]-1) Sm
    <span style="float: right;">(1)</span>
    </div>

    <p></p>

    where U, Th and Sm are expressed in mol &mu;m<sup>−3</sup> or
    similar units, He is the molar abundance of helium released from
    the ablation pit (in moles) and V is the ablation pit volume (in
    &mu;m<sup>3</sup>). Alternately, the <i>pairwise</i> dating
    approach can be used, where the concentrations and pit volumes are
    normalized to a mineral standard of known (U–Th)/He age.

    <p></p>

    The measurements of U, Th, Sm and the ablation pit volume have
    associated systematic errors. <tt>resochronometer</tt> groups these
    into a single calibration factor, &kappa;:

    <p></p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    &kappa; = (He/V) / {
    8 (137.88/138.88) (exp[&lambda;<sub>238</sub>t]-1) U +
    7 (exp[&lambda;<sub>235</sub>t]-1) U /138.88 + <br>
    6 (exp[&lambda;<sub>232</sub>t]-1) Th +
    0.1499 (exp[&lambda;<sub>147</sub>t]-1) Sm }
    <span style="float: right;">(2)</span>
    </div>
    
    <p></p>

    &kappa; is unknown but can be estimated by analyzing a standard of
    known (U–Th–Sm)/He age. By measuring a series of standard zircon
    and normalizing the sample measurements to those of the standards,
    the age function can be solved and all uncertainties can be
    accounted for.
